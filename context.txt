Project Title

Health and Wellness Department Attendance and Event Management System

Goal

Develop a responsive web application that allows the BSP Health and Wellness Department (HWD) to efficiently manage, validate, and analyze attendance for all events, seminars, and wellness sessions. The system should handle Excel file uploads, manual walk-in registrations, real-time attendance validation, and automated reporting and analytics.

üß© Technical Stack

Frontend:

React.js (responsive web UI)

TailwindCSS for styling

Multer (for Excel file upload handling)

XLSX.js for reading and parsing Excel files

Database:

MySQL or PostgreSQL (relational database)

Hosting (Free or Local Options):

Free tier: Render
 or Railway.app
 (for app + DB hosting)

Local setup: Run backend via Node.js (npm run dev), and host MySQL locally using XAMPP or Docker

üß© Attendance Validation Logic

Virtual Attendance (Excel Upload)

Admin uploads Attendance.csv for a specific event.

The system cross-checks:

If employee_no exists in the registration_table for the same event_id, mark as Registered.

Otherwise, mark as Not Registered.

Automatically link demographic data (age, gender, department) via JOIN with dmag_table.

Manual Attendance (Walk-in)

Prompt:
Is this attendee a BSP Employee or Outsource Personnel?

If BSP Employee: Search by Employee No or Name from dmag_table ‚Üí auto-fill details.

If Outsource Personnel (OP): Input only Name + Department.

System inserts record into attendance_table and sets validation automatically.

üìà Reporting and Analytics

Attendance summary per event (total, virtual, onsite)

Registered vs actual attendees

Count of walk-ins

2. Overall Reports

Age range distribution (based on joined dmag_table)

Attendance growth per quarter or month

ROI Estimation: based on attendance rate vs resource utilization (formula customizable)

3. Export Options

Reports downloadable as .xlsx or .pdf

Filters by: Event Type, Date Range, Department
